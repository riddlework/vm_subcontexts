Title: Use of the Seg Fault Handler in Enabling and Disabling Permissions between Subcontexts

In the matchmaker, whose code can be found in sbc_mm.c, a segfault handler
should be used for the SEGV signal. When a client process maps a subcontext
into its virtual memory and makes a function call into this mapped subcontext,
a seg fault should be triggered and handled and all execute permissions for the
client process (except the necessary ones, such as for the library) should be
disabled, and execution permissions for the area of the mapped subcontext that
is being executed should be enabled. When execution finishes in the mapped
subcontext and moves back to the client subcontext, the inverse of this should
happen.

All changes should be made in sbc_mm.c
