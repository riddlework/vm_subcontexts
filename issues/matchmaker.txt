The matchmaker needs to be built and/or fixed and should mediate all
interactions between outer and inner subcontexts by registering the SEGV signal
and handling it by writing a seg fault handler. The matchmaker should be a part
of the client library. If a process picks up the client library it should
implicitly pick up the matchmaker. See the design documents for more
information on how the matchmaker should function.

All changes should be made in sbc_mm.c
