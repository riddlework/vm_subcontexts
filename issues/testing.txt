A complete testing suite should be written. We need to test three overarching
aspects of the code:

    The server library: comprehensive testing should include (but not be
    limited to) a process serializing its memory maps into a ".img" file
   
    The client library: comprehensive testing should include (but not be
    limited to) a process mapping one of the preexisting image files into its
    memory and making function calls into the mapped subcontext.
    
    The matchmaker: the matchmaker should mediate all interactions between the
    outer and inner subcontexts, using a seg fault handler that registers the
    SEGV signal. Testing should include testing the seg fault handler and all
    appropriate functions within the matchmaker.
