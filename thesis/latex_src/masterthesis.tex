%% This is a dissertation template for use with Masters/PhD dissertations at the University of Arizona.
%%
%% This template was created in 2022 and subsequently updated by Samuel A. Myers to greatly simplify the 
%% old thesis template. This was done to make the template easier to use, less intimidating, and because
%% the old template had not been actively updated in over a decade. Furthermore, in recent years the Grad 
%% College has greatly relaxed thesis requirmenets, and so the hyperspecific formatting guidelines utilized in
%% the old template were no longer relevant. 
%%
%% Also note that all of the AAS compatability has been explicitly removed, however it can easily be added back
%% by simply including the relevant packages in the preamble. This shouldn't break the template (with the exeption
%% of deluxetable, which is evil and should never be used).
%%
%% This template was made to match the guidelines as listed here (https://arizona.app.box.com/v/grad-gsas-dissformat)
%% in Jan of 2024. As always, check to make sure that your thesis is compliant before submitting it. If you
%% find any errors, please let the current LPL template manager or grad webmaster know. Furthermore, Be aware that 
%% there are some "secret" requirements that they don't tell you about until you are submitting your thesis. For
%% the most part these should be small things, but if you have problems, reach out to the template manager.
%%
%% This template is based on an old template that utilized a custom LaTeX class. That template was
%% worked on from the late 80's to early 2000's by a series of graduate students in the Department of
%% Planetary Sciences. Although much of that template has been scrapped, this template is still heavily based
%% on it, and much of their sample text has been utilized. The following is a list of all the students who
%% have worked on various thesis templates.
%%
%% Peter Halverson	1989 (non-LPL)
%% William D. Sears	1994
%% Rov Vervack		1996
%% Andrew Rivkin	1997
%% Joe Spitale		2001
%% Dave O'Brien		2003
%% Ross A. Beyer	2004
%% Jim Richardson	2005
%% Terry Hurford	2005
%% Curtis S. Cooper	2007
%% David A. Minton  2009
%% Samuel A. Myers	2024
%%
%% To compile this template, the recommend run sequence is:
%% PdfLaTeX + Bib(la)tex + PdfLaTeX (x2)
%% This should ensure the references, figures, tables, table of contents, etc are all updated fully and correctly.
%% If using Overleaf, Overleaf should take care of this automatically.
%%
%% If you have any questions and its before ~2026, please feel free to email sammyers@arizona.edu


\documentclass[12pt]{report} %Sets default font size and report format
    %To align the page numbers for double sided printing use \textbf{\documentclass[12pt,twoside]{report}}
    %You will also have to change a line (noted below) under Set up for fancyhdr and comment out a line
    %under both the List of Figures and List of Tables (also noted below).
    %Note that twosided page numbers are nicer for printing, but ARE NOT COMPLIANT with the requirements

%------------------------------------Import our packages----------------------------------------------
%These are all the packages required for the base template. Note that you may find other packages useful

\usepackage{hyperref}
	%Governs how hyperlinks are displayed and used

	%Allows citing a full reference inline
\usepackage[all]{nowidow}
    %Removes "widow" and "orphan" lines, i.e. single lines at the top or bottom of a page that start

\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\thispagestyle{fancy} %Resets custom page number location and first chapter page

I would like to thank my advisor, Russell Lewis, who gracefully agreed to take me on as an advisee despite the fact that I would be working through the summer semester.

I would also like to thank the cities of San Francisco, Los Alamos, Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Berlin, and, most of all, Paris, whose joie de vivre gave me the motivation I needed to write what I have here written.





%----------------------------------------------Dedication------------------------------------------------
% This section is optional. To remove it simply comment out all of the lines betweeen here and the next
% section. This should be limited to one page, although this is not explicitly listed in the formatting
% requirements.

\begin{center}
\textit{I dedicate this thesis to my brother, Jeremiah, who taught me what I know, and to my mother, who has always cheered me on.}
\end{center}



%--------------------------------------Table of Contents--------------------------------------------------
% Note that at all entries in the TOC must be formatted as they are in the text, i.e. if a title is bolded
% in the text it must be bolded in the TOC. This will be done automatically if you don't change any of the
% formating.

The codebase for the implementation of the prototype for virtual memory subcontexts is contained within this \href{https://github.com/riddlework/vm_subcontexts}{repository}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/riddlework/vm_subcontexts}{https://github.com/riddlework/vm\_subcontexts}}, which is hosted on Github. It contains all the source and testing code for our prototype, as well as the LaTeX source code for this thesis, which was adapted from the University of Arizona's standard graduate dissertation template.
