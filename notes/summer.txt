1. Develop matchmaker subcontext image file
2. Convert libraries from shared to static
    -- This would require generating ELF executables by hand
3. Enforce the permission restriction on regular processes mapping subcontext vs. the 
    matchmaker subcontext, which should have much looser permission restrictions.
    -- Make use of the SEGV signal handler in implementing this.
4. Modify client library to map with mprotect to protection none.
5. Have the client library keep a global list of mapped subcontexts, and have the ability
    to map multiple subcontexts.
6. A function call from a client process into a server process should cause a seg fault, which
    we will then handle.
    -- Here is where we make use of the SEGV signal handler.
    -- Turn permissions on/off for the current subcontext in this way
